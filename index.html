      <h1>Cherokee History</h1>

      <section id="history">
        Cherokee, North American Indians of Iroquoian lineage who constituted
        one of the largest politically integrated tribes at the time of European
        colonization of the Americas. Their name is derived from a Creek word
        meaning “people of different speech”; many prefer to be known as
        Keetoowah or Tsalagi. They are believed to have numbered some 22,500
        individuals in 1650, and they controlled approximately 40,000 square
        miles (100,000 square km) of the Appalachian Mountains in parts of
        present-day Georgia, eastern Tennessee, and the western parts of what
        are now North Carolina and South Carolina. Traditional Cherokee life and
        culture greatly resembled that of the Creek and other tribes of the
        Southeast. The Cherokee nation was composed of a confederacy of
        symbolically red (war) and white (peace) towns. The chiefs of individual
        red towns were subordinated to a supreme war chief, while the officials
        of individual white towns were under the supreme peace chief. The peace
        towns provided sanctuary for wrongdoers; war ceremonies were conducted
        in red towns.
